## TODO

- image pyramid should allow user-specified smoothing
- image pyramid should allow user-specified shrink-factors instead of fixed reduction by factor of 2
- add callback mechanism for convergence reporting (with example use with tensorboard, optional dependency)
- add convergence tolerance options, or allow user to provide the optimizer
- profile execution and improve speed
- add spell-checker pre-commit hook
- skip CI if changes only affect markdown files
